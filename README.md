## 🎨 My Pookalam

### Description

This digital pookalam is built using **Joy Creative Coding**.  I created my Pookalam design by taking inspiration from Pinterest for the visual style. For the coding part, I developed the code myself, using references from the tutorial. I experimented recursively and adjusted values repeatedly to achieve the final design, combining creativity with precision to produce a vibrant digital Pookalam.
The design has multiple colorful layers:
- Brown base circle with red & yellow rotated rectangle rings  
- Violet circle and white floral pattern with 8 large petals  
- Concentric rectangle layers (yellow, red, brown)  
- A central flower made of **four layers of flowers** (white, brown, red, yellow)  
- Finished with a small brown–yellow circle at the core 🌸

### Features
- Colorful geometric patterns – layered circles, rectangles, and petals create a vibrant, symmetrical design.
- Iterative design process – shapes are repeated, rotated, and scaled programmatically for precision.
- Layered floral motifs – inner and outer patterns mimic traditional Pookalam structures.
- Customizable parameters – colors, sizes, and rotations can be adjusted to create new variations.
